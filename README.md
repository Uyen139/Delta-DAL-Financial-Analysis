**Delta's Financial Analysis**
-------------------------------------------
Conducted a comprehensive analysis of Delta's financial metrics in 10 years (2013-2022) and assessed the enterprise value to determine its investment potential, culminating in a Buy, Hold, or Sell recommendation for the stock. This involved gathering and comparing financial statements from Delta and its competitors, and developing both Discounted Cash Flow and Relative Value models to estimate Delta's projected stock price.
